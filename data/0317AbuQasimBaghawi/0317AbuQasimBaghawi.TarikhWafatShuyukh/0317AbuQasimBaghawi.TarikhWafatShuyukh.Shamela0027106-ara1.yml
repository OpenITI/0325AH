90#VERS#COMMENT##: The book contains 282 numbers and each number is
    about the date of death of a person. Since these are not biographies, I
    avoided tagging them as ### $; however (as Maxim pointed out) it’s
    possible to automatically add this tag to the beginning of each number,
    if needed.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
