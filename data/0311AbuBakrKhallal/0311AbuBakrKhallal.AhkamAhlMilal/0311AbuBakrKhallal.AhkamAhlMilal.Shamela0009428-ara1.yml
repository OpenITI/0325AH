90#VERS#COMMENT##: Overall good correspondence between texts. Page numbers are
    missing in the bracketed pagination section, i.e., PageV00P000. The bracketed
    prayers after prophets' names are missing in the digital text. Also,
    occasionally there would a few word choices used in the digital text that are
    different from those in the printed text. There's an extra subheading added
    between 55 & 56. Also, all the footnoted names of Quranic chapters and cited
    verse number in the printed text are not always automatically embedded in the
    body of digital text.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Replaced the $ tag for Khabar with **.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
