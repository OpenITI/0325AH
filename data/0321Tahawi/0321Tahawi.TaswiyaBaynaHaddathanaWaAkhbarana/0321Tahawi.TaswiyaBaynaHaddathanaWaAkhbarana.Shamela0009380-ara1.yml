90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: PV
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The introduction is different from the collated edition, but
        the text (and pagination) of the body is identical.
        The digital text was missing the last three pages; PV typed them up.
        PV tagged the editorial introduction and the paratext at the end,
        and removed a number of incorrect tags at the start of citations.
        NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): No changes.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
