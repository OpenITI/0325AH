90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Mathew Barber
90#VERS#COMMENT##: removed page headers from middle of text (e.g. سنه
    281), added more headings for earlier sections based on the Leiden
    edition, removed headings marked ### === (headings added by shamela) or
    turned them into mARkdown headings placing heading between [] to
    indicate it was added by shamela.
   NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): 1- The first-level headers for volumes removed and all headers moved up by one level. 2- Major changes in levelling of the headers made, mostly in the first two volumes. 3- Two titles in PageV01P009 and PageV01P032 broken to make the structure clearer. 4- PARATEXT added. 5- The annotator has separated the sub-chapters by blank header tags. Since blank headers does not tell us anything about the structure, titles should be added here in square brackets. 6- Another edition of the text is accessible here: https://archive.org/details/1879p.d.f1709
