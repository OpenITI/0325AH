90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I think the short part in PageV01P121-2 should be tagged as PARATEXT; however, I'm not sure about this. 2- It would be better to add numbers at the beginning of
    each name.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
