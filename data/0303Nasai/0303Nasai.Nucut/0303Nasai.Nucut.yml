90#BOOK#COMMENT##: This book is in fact a part of al-Nasā'ī's Kitāb al-
    Sunan al-Kubrá (ed. al-Bindārī, vol. 4 pp. 393-421). The editor used
    6
    manuscripts of al-Sunan al-Kubrá for his edition (see pp. 51-54) and
    explains his decision for the re-edition of  this section of the
    text by
    the many lacunae in the edition (p. 56)
