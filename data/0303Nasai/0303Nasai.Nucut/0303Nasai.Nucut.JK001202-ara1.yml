90#VERS#COMMENT##: Added structural tags and extracted footnotes (the
    footnotes in the digitized text are only a fraction  of the footnotes in
    the printed edition; only the akhrajahu statements from the critical
    apparatus were digitized).
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): Editorial removed. A few untagged headers tagged.
    Deleted three remaining akhrajahu which was entered from the footnote.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
